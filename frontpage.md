## Introduction

Bismuth is a new blockchain protocol and a platform at the same time. It has an innovative approach to database scaling, introduces the concept of private contracts and limits contract execution to users willing to participate, while keeping them publicly verifiable through alternative mechanisms proposed by Nick Szabo. With Bismuth, you can choose from plethora of fully open sourced projects, use plugins to limitlessly extend scaling capacities and options through selective node behavior and custom layers. Sky is the limit.

### Hyperblocks

Hyperblock technology allows transactions to be compressed regularly, reducing the size of the blockchain to the amount of accounts present in it. Currently it saves 96% of RAM usage and enables users to save as much drive space when their client is configured only for hyperblocks.

### Data & Operations

OpenField allows users to save their data into the blockchain, including private and public messages, communication with decentralized application interpreters, document fingerprinting for legal purposes, complex operations for shared-state contract execution.

### Applied Robotics

Professor Geir Hovland, PhD. from University of Agder co-authored the innovative nonlinear feedback control mechanism used for difficulty retargeting in Bismuth. For the first time in history, blockchain meets top-level technology from robotics.

### Polysign

Bismuth will support multiple cryptographic algorithms, signing and address formats to protect users from quantum attacks. The mix will include current RSA, SHA224, newly introducing ECDSA (SECP256k1) and BLAKE2b

  
### Hypernodes

The HyperNode design for Bismuth includes a secondary proof of stake blockchain to collect metrics independently and without interference in order to reward users who provide reliable nodes.

### Privacy

We fully support Tor's onion network integration for completely concealed transaction routing. Bismuth also provides a transaction mixer private contract based on public key encryption to make sender and recipient unlinkable.

### Intellipool

To keep transaction fees low, Bismuth introduces a programmable mempool solution, which allows to prioritize transactions based on their partially configurable properties. This prevents transaction delays.

### Semantics

The concept of operations abstracted from normal blocks, but stored outside of them, enables unlimited content including on-chain forking without disturbing the underlaying system.
